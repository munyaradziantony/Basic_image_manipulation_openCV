# HW1

## How to do the homework?

You have accepted the invitation to the assignment, and now you have to copy the files so that you can start your work. This instruction assumes that you are using the command line git.

In the command window or the terminal, 

1. First go to your class folder, say `/MAE6292`. 

2. Execute (after replacing `YOUR-GITHUB-ID` with your own ID):

   ``git clone https://github.com/GW-MAE6292/hw1-YOUR-GITHUB-ID.git ./hw1`` 

   This will copy the above files to your folder `/MAE6292/hw1'

3. Now, open `hw1.ipynb` using Juptyer Notebook and complete the work.

4. Once your work is done, there will be two new files, namely `prob1.png` and `prob2.png`. You have to package these files in git, before submitting it.

   ``git add prob1.png prob2.png``

   ``git commit -a -m "done"``

5. Now, you are ready to submit your work by

   ``git push``

   You may have to enter your GitHub id and password, if this is the first time pusing something to github.

6. Finally, come back to this page, to make it sure that all of your files are posted properly.
